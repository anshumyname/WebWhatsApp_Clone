# Web Whatsapp Clone
In this project I have aimed to make a clone of web whatsapp with most basic features like making profile , chat with other person, and tracking online/offline, search for friends . Instead of linking with phone number this works on google authentication. Since i haven't introduced any friends concept so all the users will be able to chat with each other.
